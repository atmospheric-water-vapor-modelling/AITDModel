# AITDModel
Augmented Iterative Tropospheric  Decomposition Model

This software is implemented in MATLAB R2022a for high-resolution atmospheric water vapor generation. 

Two experiments and validations have been done in Italy and Sweden. See details in the paper Augmented Iterative Tropospheric Decomposition Strategy for GNSS-based Atmospheric Water Vapor Map Generation later......

To use this software, see the 'app.m' file firstly, please.
